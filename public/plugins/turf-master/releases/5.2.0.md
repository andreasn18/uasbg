### Crowdsourced Funding

#### Why we're looking for support

TurfJS is a community-driven project maintained by a small group of core contributors who work on the project in their spare time. Time is spent supporting users, improving documentation, fixing bugs as well as creating new modules. Your funding will directly go to development costs, marketing campaigns, promotional events & any other financial costs to operate & maintain TurfJS.

In particular, we're looking for corporate sponsors who use TurfJS in revenue-generating ways, either by creating applications for clients, or through use in an app used by customers. Of course individuals are welcome to support us as well if TurfJS has helped you :)
